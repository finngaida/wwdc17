# WWDC 2017 Scholarship submission

![](Oscilloscope.playgroundbook/Contents/Resources/icon.png)

This year's challenge for [Apple's WWDC Scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships) was to build a [Swift Playground](http://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds).    
There were many different approaches as to what concept would be used, but I went for the educational `playgroundbook`.

## What?
This file needs to be opened on an iPad with iOS 10+ and Swift Playgrounds installed and will visually explain the features and internals of an [**Oscilloscope**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope), check it out!

## How'd it go?
Results will be made public by the Jury on *April 21*, I'm very excited.
