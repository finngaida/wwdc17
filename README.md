# WWDC 2017 Scholarship submission
---
## TMS application
Hello TMS application review team!

I sent you here to showcase some of my work as an iOS developer.		
In 2015 and 2017 I have successfully applied for the annual Apple WWDC scholarship competition, awarding me each a ticket to the conference and lodging in San Francisco/San Jose. This was my application for the 2017 competition.		
It's a Swift playground containing a simulation of an oscilloscope - you can find more info below or in my [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H59g7t1bB4).

This year's challenge for [Apple's WWDC Scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships) was to build a [Swift Playground](http://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds).    
There were many different approaches as to what concept would be used, but I went for the educational `playgroundbook`.

## What?
This file needs to be opened on an iPad with iOS 10+ and Swift Playgrounds installed and will visually explain the features and internals of an [**Oscilloscope**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope), check it out!

## How'd it go?
I was awarded a scholarship ðŸŽ‰
